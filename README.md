**[Implementing Behavior trees using three valued logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03835)** (T. de Souza; Preprint) 

With consideration to behavior trees and their relevance to planning and control, within and without game development, the distinction between stateful and stateless models is discussed; a three-valued logic bridging traditional control flow with behavior trees is introduced, and a C# implementation is presented.

**[Society of neurons: an arts/science project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1056224.1056281)** - 2005 (W. Neidich, R. Zimmer, T. de Souza)

This artwork is one of the deliverables of an arts/science initiative supported by an interdisciplinary program run by Arts Council England and the Arts and Humanities Research Board of the UK. The artwork has two forms: one is a dynamically changing website and the other is a series of three-dimensional sculptures, each of which records a segment of history of the website. The website itself---which we think of as a web brain---evolves using principles that model those that are posited as the processes that happen in brains as they learn. The website evolution is informed by interaction with a large community of users and therefore acts as a collective memory of a society of individuals.

**[A psychosocial model for the evolution of aesthetic patterns](https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/11034)** - 2002 (T. de Souza, T. Kalganova)

This paper describes an original attempt to evolve aesthetic patterns by integrating the rules of colour psychology into a multi-agent evolutionary model. The system uses the principles of evolution to determine social relationships between agents. Communication plays an important role in the evolution of social behaviour. In our case the exchange of information between agents determines their behavioural characteristics. The interaction between agents and their social behaviour may be controlled and monitored using real-time image animation technique.

**[Behaviour trees and the future of intelligent control](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ThibaudDeSouza/20201012/371528/Behavior_trees_and_the_future_of_intelligent_control.php)** - 2020 (T. de Souza)

Since Isla's seminal article, behavior trees (BT) have become a well recognized framework for designing and managing game AIs.
Even so, a game logic programmer may not immediately perceive their usefulness, and AI engineers may occasionally tell you that they aren't really game AI \[...\]; I discuss stateless vs stateful control and the key decisions informing the design of our BT library.

**[The blind game designer: darwinism in a fast paced, casual action game](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ThibaudDeSouza/20140421/215874/The_Blind_Game_Designer__Darwinism_in_a_fast_pace_casual_action_game.php)** - 2014 (T. de Souza)

One the features of Darwin's Nightmare is the use of evolutionary computation to drive the exploration of a large combinatorial space defining the behaviour and appearance of enemy crafts. In this game, all enemy craft designs are obtained by varying a unique genotype: whenever a new ship appears on the screen, individuals are selected from a mating pool and their digital DNA is recombined to create a new type.
